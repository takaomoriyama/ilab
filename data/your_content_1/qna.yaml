      The word polymer is derived from the classical Greek words poly meaning
      “many” and meres meaning “parts.” Simply stated, a polymer is a long-chain mole-
      cule that is composed of a large number of repeating units of identical structure.
      Certain polymers, such as proteins, cellulose, and silk, are found in nature, while
      many others, including polystyrene, polyethylene, and nylon, are produced only by
      synthetic routes. In some cases, naturally occurring polymers can also be produced
      synthetically. An important example is natural (Hevea) rubber, known as polyiso-
      prene in its synthetic form.
      Polymers that are capable of high extension under ambient conditions find im-
      portant applications as elastomers. In addition to natural rubber, there are several
      important synthetic elastomers including nitrile and butyl rubber. Other polymers
      may have characteristics that enable their fabrication into long fibers suitable for
      textile applications. The synthetic fibers, principally nylon and polyester, are good
      substitutes for naturally occurring fibers such as cotton, wool, and
      silk.
      In contrast to the usage of the word polymer, those commercial materials other
      than elastomers and fibers that are derived from synthetic polymers are called plas-
      tics. A typical commercial plastic resin may contain two or more polymers in addi-
      tion to various additives and fillers. These are added to improve a particular proper-
      ty such as processability, thermal or environmental stability, or mechanical proper-
      ties.
      The birth of polymer science may be traced back to the mid-nineteenth centu-
      ry. In the 1830s, Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanization process that trans-
      formed the sticky latex of natural rubber into a useful elastomer for tire use. In
      1847, Christian F. Schönbein reacted cellulose with nitric acid to produce cellulose
      nitrate. This was used in the 1860s as the first man-made thermoplastic, celluloid. In
      1907, Leo Hendrik Baekeland [1] produced Bakelite (phenol−formaldehyde resin).
      Glyptal (unsaturated-polyester resin) was developed as a protective coating resin by
      General Electric in 1912.
      By the 1930s, researchers at DuPont in the United States had produced a vari-
      ety of new polymers including synthetic rubber and more “exotic” materials such as
      nylon and Teflon. By 1938, Dow had produced polystyrene in commercial scale for
      the first time and, in 1939, polyethylene (low-density) was made by scientists at ICI
      in England. Efforts to develop new polymeric materials, particularly synthetic rub-
      ber, were intensified during World War II when many naturally occurring materials
      such as Hevea rubber were in short supply. In the 1950s, Karl Ziegler and Giulio
      Natta independently developed a family of stereospecific transition-metal catalysts
      that made possible the commercialization of polypropylene as a major commodity
      plastic. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the development of a number of high-
      performance engineering plastics polymers that could compete favorably with more
      traditional materials, such as metals, for automotive and aerospace applications.
      These included polycarbonate, poly(phenylene oxide), polysulfones, polyimides,
      aromatic polyamides such as Kevlar, and other high-temperature rigid-chain poly-
      mers. More recently, specialty polymers with electrically conducting, photocon-
      ducting, and liquid-crystalline properties have appeared for a variety of applica-
      tions.
      Today, polymeric materials are used in nearly all areas of daily life and their
      production and fabrication are major worldwide industries. The annual U.S. produc-
      tion of plastics and synthetic fibers in 2012 and the average annual change in pro-
      duction over the decade from 2002 to 2012 are given in Table 1-1. In 2012, the total
      U.S. production of synthetic fibers (principally non-cellulosic) and plastics was 2.81
      and 34.1 million metric tons, respectively. Among plastics, the largest shares of the
      total production in 2012 were the polyethylenes, followed by polypropylene,
      poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and polystyrene. Although not specifically listed by the
      data given in Table 1-1, thermosetting resins (principally phenolic, urea, and mela-
      mine resins) typically represent around 10% of the total plastics production
      while synthetic rubbers, such as styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR) and polybutadiene, rep-
      resent only about 6% of the total production in recent years.

      Thousands of different polymers have been synthesized and more will be produced
      in the future. Conveniently, all polymers can be assigned to one of two groups
      based upon their processing characteristics or the type of polymerization mecha-
      nism. A more specific classification can be made on the basis of polymer structure.
      Such groupings are useful because they facilitate the discussion of
      properties.
      All polymers can be divided into two major groups based on their thermal pro-
      cessing behavior. Those polymers that can be heat-softened in order to process into
      a desired form are called thermoplastics. Waste thermoplastics can be recovered
      and refabricated by application of heat and pressure. Polystyrene is an important
      example of a commercial thermoplastic. Other major examples are the polyolefins
      (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene) and poly(vinyl chloride). In comparison,
      thermosets are polymers whose individual chains have been chemically linked by
      covalent bonds during polymerization or by subsequent chemical or thermal treat-
      ment during fabrication. Once formed, these crosslinked networks resist heat
      soft-
      ening, mechanical deformation, and solvent attack, but cannot be thermally pro-
      cessed. Such properties make thermosets suitable materials for composites, coat-
      ings, and adhesive applications. Principal examples of thermosets include epoxy,
      phenol–formaldehyde resins, and unsaturated polyesters that are used in the manu-
      facture of glass-reinforced composites such as Fiberglas (see Section 7.4).
      In addition to classifying polymers on the basis of their processing characteristics,
      polymers may also be classified according to their mechanism of polymerization.
      An early scheme classifies polymers as either addition or condensation—a scheme
      attributed to Wallace Carothers [2], a pioneer of the polymer industry working at
      DuPont from 1928 until his untimely death in 1937. Polystyrene, which is polymer-
      ized by a sequential addition of styrene monomers (see Figure 1-1), is an example
      of an addition polymer. Most important addition polymers are polymerized from
      olefins and vinyl-based monomers. A few other polymers that are traditionally rec-
      ognized as belonging to the addition class are polymerized not by addition to an
      ethylene double bond but through a ring-opening polymerization of a sterically
      strained cyclic monomer. An example is the ring-opening polymerization of triox-
      ane to form polyoxymethylene (an engineering thermoplastic), which is illustrated
      in Figure 1-2. Table 1-2 lists the chemical structure of the repeating units and the
      commonly used nomenclature of some of the most important addition-type poly-
      mers derived from substituted ethylene.
      A molecule participating in a polycondensation reaction may be a monomer, oligo-
      mer, or higher-molecular-weight intermediate each having complementary func-
      tional end units, such as carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups. Typically, condensa-
      tion polymerizations occur by the liberation of a small molecule in the form of a
      gas, water, or salt. Any high-yield condensation reaction such as esterification or
      amidation can be used to obtain a high-molecular-weight polymer. An example of a
      condensation polymerization is the synthesis of nylon-6,6 by the polycondensation
      of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine as illustrated in Figure 1-3A. This
      polymerization is accompanied by the liberation of two molecules of water for each
      repeating unit. Another important example of a polycondensation, illustrated in Fig-
      ure 1-3B, is the preparation of polycarbonate from bisphenol-A and phosgene. In
      this case, two molecules of hydrogen chloride are formed for each repeating unit.
      Alternatively, if the sodium salt of bisphenol-A was used in the polymerization, the
      by-product of the condensation would be sodium chloride rather than hydrogen
      chloride. The salt will precipitate out of the organic solvent used for the polymeriza-
      tion and, therefore, can be easily and safely removed. Some other examples of con-
      densation polymers are given in Table 1-3.

      In addition to classification based upon processing and polymerization characteris-
      tics, polymers may also be grouped based upon the chemical structure of their
      backbones. For example, polymers having all carbon atoms along their backbone
      are important examples of homochain polymers. They may be further classified de-
      pending upon whether there are single or double bonds along their backbone.
      Carbon-chain polymers with only single bonds along the backbone are called poly-
      alkylenes (or polyalkylidenes). Examples of polyalkylenes include polystyrene, the
      polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), and poly(vinyl chloride). Car-
      bon-chain polymers with double bonds along the chain such as the diene
      elastomers—polyisoprene and polybutadiene—are called polyalkenylenes. Another
      example of a polyalkenylene is polyacetylene, an electrically conducting polymer
      (see Section 10.2.7).
      Heterochain polymers that contain more than one atom type in their backbone
      are grouped according to the types of atoms and chemical groups (e.g., carbonyl,
      amide, or ester) located along the backbone. The most important classes of organic
      heterochain polymers are listed in Table 1-4. Another important class of hetero-
      chain polymers includes polysiloxanes. These have a –Si–O– backbone with methyl
      or other substituent groups attached to silicon.

      Section 1.2: Polymer Structure
      The properties of polymers are strongly influenced by details of the chain structure.
      These details include the overall chemical composition and the sequence of
      mono-
      mer units in the case of copolymers, the stereochemistry or tacticity of the chain,
      and the geometric isomerization in the case of diene-type polymers for which sever-
      al synthesis routes may be possible.
      Often, it is possible to obtain polymers with new and desirable properties by linking
      two or three different monomers or repeating units during the polymerization. Poly-
      mers with two different repeating units in their chains are called copolymers. When
      there are three chemically different repeating units, the resulting polymer is termed
      a terpolymer. Commercially, the most important copolymers are derived from vinyl
      monomers such as styrene, ethylene, acrylonitrile, and vinyl chloride.
      The exact sequence of monomer units along the chain can vary widely de-
      pending upon the relative reactivities of each monomer during the copolymerization
      process. At the extremes, monomer placement may be totally random or may be
      perfectly alternating, as illustrated in Figure 1-4. The actual sequence of monomer
      units is determined by the relative reactivities of the monomers as will be described
      for free-radical copolymerization in Section 2.2.1. Under special circumstances, it is
      possible to prepare copolymers that contain a long block of one monomer (A) fol-
      lowed by a block of the other monomer (B). These are called AB-block copolymers.
      ABA-triblock copolymers have a central B block joined by A blocks at both ends.
      A commercially important ABA-triblock copolymer is polystyrene-block-
      polybutadiene-block-polystyrene or SBS, a thermoplastic elastomer (see Section
      9.2.3). In addition to these copolymer structures, graft copolymers can be prepared
      by polymerizing a monomer in the presence of a fully formed polymer of another
      monomer. Graft copolymers are important as elastomers (e.g., SBR) and high-
      impact polymers (e.g., high-impact polystyrene and acrylontrile−butadiene−styrene
      or ABS resin).
      In addition to the type, number, and sequential arrangement of monomers along the
      chain, the spatial arrangement of substituent groups is also important in determining
      properties. The possible steric configurations of an asymmetric vinyl-polymer chain
      can be best represented by drawing the chain in its extended-chain or planar zigzag
      conformation, as illustrated in Figure 1-5. A conformation describes the geometrical
      arrangement of atoms in the polymer chain while configuration denotes the stereo-
      chemical arrangement of atoms. Unlike the conformation, the configuration of a
      polymer chain cannot be altered without breaking chemical bonds. For long, flexi-
      ble polymer chains, the total number of conformations is nearly infinite. The
      ex-
      tended-chain conformation for vinyl polymers is often the lowest-energy confor-
      mation.
      As illustrated in Figure 1-5, several different placements of the asymmetric
      substituent group, R, are possible. As examples, a substituent group may be a me-
      thyl group as in polypropylene, a chlorine atom as in poly(vinyl chloride), or a phe-
      nyl ring as in polystyrene. In one configuration, all the R groups may lie on the
      same side of the plane formed by the extended-chain backbone. Such polymers are
      termed isotactic. If the substituent groups regularly alternate from one side of the
      plane to the other, the polymer is termed syndiotactic. Polymers with no preferred
      placement are atactic. More complicated arrangements of substituent groups are
      possible in the case of 1,2-disubstituted polymers; however, these are commercially
      less important and will not be discussed here.
      In general, tactic polymers (i.e., isotactic or syndiotactic) are partially crystal-
      line, while atactic polymers are amorphous indicating the absence of all crystalline
      order. In addition to crystallinity, other polymer properties, such as thermal and
      mechanical behavior, can be significantly affected by the tacticity of the polymer as
      later examples will show. Whether a specific polymer will be atactic, isotactic, or
      syndiotactic depends upon the specific conditions of the polymerization, such as the
      temperature and choice of solvent, as will be discussed in Chapter 2. Commercial
      polypropylene is an important example of an isotactic polymer. Atactic and syndio-
      tactic forms of this polymer can also be prepared by controlling the polymerization
      conditions. Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous, tacky polymer with no com-
      mercial importance. Commercial poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is an example of a
      polymer with imperfect tactic structure. Although the overall structure of commer-
      cial-grade PVC can be reasonably characterized as atactic, there are populations of
      repeating units whose sequences are highly syndiotactic and that impart a small de-
      gree of crystallinity to the commercial resin. Space-filling (CPK) models of a short
      PVC chain having eight repeating units with all isotactic and all syndiotactic place-
      ments of the chlorine atoms are shown in Figure 1-6. Using special polymerization
      methods, PVC with very high syndiotactic or isotactic content can be made (see
      Section 9.1.2); however, these crystalline stereoisomers of PVC offer no important
      advantage compared to the commercial plastic. In the case of polystyrene, syndio-
      tactic polystyrene has been obtained by metallocene polymerization (see Section
      2.2.3) and is being studied as an alternative to the atactic “crystal grade” plastic for
      some applications (see Section 9.1.2).
      When there are unsaturated sites along a polymer chain, several different isomeric
      forms are possible. As illustrated by Figure 1-7, 1,3-butadiene (structure A) can be
      polymerized to give 1,2-poly(1,3-butadiene) (B) or either of two geometric isomers
      of 1,4-poly(1,3-butadiene) (C and D). The numbers preceding the poly prefix desig-
      nate the first and last carbon atoms of the backbone repeating unit. 1,2-poly(1,3-
      butadiene) has a vinyl-type structure, where the substituent group (ethene) contains
      an unsaturated site; therefore, this geometric isomer can be atactic, syndiotactic, or
      isotactic. In the case of the commercially more important 1,4-poly(1,3-butadiene),
      all four carbons in the repeating unit lie along the chain. Carbons 1 and 4 can lie
      either on the same side of the central double bond (i.e., cis-configuration, C) or on
      the opposite side (i.e., trans-configuration, D). The structure of polybutadiene used
      in SBR rubber (i.e., a copolymer of styrene and butadiene) is principally the trans-
      1,4 isomer with some cis-1,4- and 1,2-poly(1,3-butadiene) content.
      As the preceding examples illustrate, a very large number of different polymer
      structures are possible. In order to identify these as unambiguously as possible, it is
      important to have a robust nomenclature system. As is already evident, simple vinyl
      polymers are designated by attaching the prefix poly to the monomer name (e.g.,
      polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene); however, when the monomer name
      consists of more than one word or is preceded by a letter or number, the monomer is
      enclosed by parentheses preceded by the prefix poly. For example, the polymer ob-
      tained from the polymerization of 4-chlorostyrene is poly(4-chlorostyrene) and that
      from vinyl acetate is poly(vinyl acetate). Tacticity may be noted by prefixing the
      letter i (isotactic) or s (syndiotactic) before poly as in i-polystyrene. Geometric and
      structural isomers may be indicated by using the appropriate prefixes, cis or trans
      and 1,2- or 1,4-, before poly, as in trans-1,4-poly(1,3-butadiene).
      Nomenclature rules for non-vinyl polymers such as condensation polymers are
      generally more complicated than for vinyl monomers. These polymers are usually
      named according to the initial monomer or the functional group of the repeating
      unit. For example, the most important commercial nylon, commonly called nylon-
      6,6 (66 or 6/6), is more descriptively called poly(hexamethylene adipamide) denot-
      ing the polyamidation of hexamethylenediamine (alternatively called 1,6-hexane
      diamine) with adipic acid (see Figure 1-3A). Similarly, the aliphatic nylon obtained
      by the polyamidation of hexamethylenediamine with a 10-carbon dicarboxylic acid,
      sebacic acid, is nylon-6,10 or poly(hexamethylene sebacamide) (see structure
      shown in Table 1-3).
      In some cases, “common” names are used almost exclusively in place of the
      more chemically correct nomenclature. For example, the polycondensation of phos-
      gene and bisphenol-A—the common name for 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane—
      produces the engineering thermoplastic, polycarbonate (Figure 1-3B). Often, the
      prefix bisphenol-A is placed before polycarbonate to distinguish it from other poly-
      carbonates that can be polymerized by using bisphenol monomers other than bis-
      phenol-A, such as tetramethylbisphenol-A.
      For many years, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
      (IUPAC) and the American Chemical Society (ACS) have developed a detailed,
      structure-based nomenclature for polymers. In addition, an industrial standard
      (ASTM D-4000) for specifying specific commercial grades of reinforced and non-
      reinforced plastics has been offered by the American Society for Testing and Mate-
      rials (ASTM).
      The IUPAC structure-based rules for naming organic, inorganic, and coordina-
      tion polymers have been compiled in several publications [3–8]. Although such
      nomenclature provides an unambiguous method for identifying the large number of
      known polymers (more than 60,000 polymers are listed in the Chemical Abstracts
      Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System, semi-systematic or trivial names and
      sometimes even principal trade names (much to the displeasure of the manufactur-
      er) continue to be used in place of the sometimes unwieldy IUPAC names. As ex-
      amples, the IUPAC name for polystyrene is poly(1-phenylethylene) and that for
      polytetrafluoroethylene
      is poly(difluoromethylene)—a polymer more typically recognized by its trademark,
      Teflon. The IUPAC name for the polycarbonate of bisphenol-A mentioned earlier is
      poly(oxycarbonyloxy-1,4-phenyleneisopropylidene-1,4-phenylene).
      For convenience, several societies have developed a very useful set of two-,
      three-, and four-letter abbreviations for the names of many common thermoplastics,
      thermosets, fibers, elastomers, and additives. Sometimes, abbreviations adopted by
      different societies for the same polymer may vary, but there is widespread agree-
      ment on the abbreviations for a large number of important polymers. These abbre-
      viations are convenient and widely used. As examples, PS is generally recognized
      as the abbreviation for polystyrene, PVC for poly(vinyl chloride), PMMA for
      poly(methyl methacrylate), PTFE for polytetrafluoroethylene, and PC for bis-

      A typical synthetic polymer sample contains chains with a wide distribution of
      chain lengths. This distribution is seldom symmetric and contains some molecules
      of very high molecular weight. A representative distribution is illustrated in Figure
      1-8. The exact breadth of the molecular-weight distribution depends upon the spe-
      cific conditions of polymerization, as will be described in Chapter 2. For example,
      the polymerization of some olefins can result in molecular-weight distributions that
      are extremely broad. In other polymerizations, polymers with very narrow molecu-
      lar-weight distributions can be obtained. As will be shown in subsequent chapters,
      many polymer properties, such as melt viscosity, are dependent on molecular
      weight and molecular-weight distribution. Therefore, it is useful to define molecu-
      lar-weight averages associated with a given molecular-weight distribution as de-
      tailed in this section.
      For a discrete distribution of molecular weights, an average molecular
      weight,,
      M may be defined as
      where Ni indicates the number of moles of molecules having a molecular weight of
      Mi and the parameter h is a weighting factor that defines a particular average of the
      molecular-weight distribution. The weight, Wi, of molecules with molecular weight
      Mi is then
      Molecular weights that are important in determining polymer properties are the
      number-average, n
      M (h = 1), the weight-average, w
      M (h = 2), and the z-average,
      M (h = 3), molecular weights.
      z
      Since the molecular-weight distribution of commercial polymers is normally a
      continuous function, molecular-weight averages can be determined by integration if
      the appropriate mathematical form of the molecular-weight distribution (i.e., N as a
      function of M as illustrated in Figure 1-8) is known or can be approximated. Such
      mathematical forms include theoretical distribution functions derived on the basis of
      a statistical consideration of an idealized polymerization, such as the Flory, Schultz,
      Tung, and Pearson distributions [9] (see Example 1.1 and Problem 1.3) and stand-
      ard probability functions, such as the Poisson and logarithmic-normal
      distributions.
      It follows from eq. (1.1) that the number-average molecular weight for a dis-
      crete distribution of molecular weights is given as
      where N is the total number of molecular-weight species in the distribution. The
      expression for the number-average molecular weight of a continuous distribution
      function is
      The respective relationships for the weight-average molecular weight of a dis-
      crete and a continuous distribution are given by
      In the case of high-molecular-weight polymers, the number-average molecular
      weight is directly determined by membrane osmometry, while the weight-average
      molecular weight is determined by light-scattering and other scattering techniques
      as described in Chapter 3. As mentioned earlier, a higher moment of the molecular-
      weight distribution is the z-average molecular weight M where h = 3. As dis-
      z
      cussed later in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3.3), a viscosity-average molecular weight,
      M can be obtained from dilute-solution viscometry. The viscosity-average molec-
      v ,
      ular weight falls between n
      M and w
      M depending upon whether the solvent is a
      good or poor solvent for the polymer. In the case of a good solvent, M M2
      v w .
      A measure of the breadth of the molecular-weight distribution is given by the
      ratios of molecular-weight averages. For this purpose, the most commonly used ra-
      M M tio is w n ,
      called the polydispersity index or PDI [9]. Recent IUPAC recom-
      mendations suggest the use of the term molar-mass dispersity, DM, for this
      ratio
      [10]. The PDIs of commercial polymers vary widely. For example, commercial
      grades of polystyrene with a n
      M of over 100,000 have polydispersity indices be-
      tween 2 and 5, while polyethylene synthesized in the presence of a stereospecific
      catalyst may have a PDI as high as 30.* In contrast, the PDI of some vinyl polymers
      prepared by “living” polymerization (see Chapter 2) can be as low as 1.06. Such
      polymers with nearly monodisperse molecular-weight distributions are useful as
      molecular-weight standards for the determination of molecular weights and molecu-
      lar-weight distributions of commercial polymers (see Section 3.3.4).
      Example 1.1
      A polydisperse sample of polystyrene is prepared by mixing three monodisperse
      samples in the following proportions:
      1 g 10,000 molecular weight
      2 g 50,000 molecular weight
      2 g 100,000 molecular weight
      Using this information, calculate the number-average molecular weight, weight-
      average molecular weight, and PDI of the mixture.
      A polymer is fractionated and is found to have the continuous molecular-weight
      distribution shown below as a plot of the weight, W, of molecules having mo-
      lecular weight, M, versus M. Given this molecular-weight distribution, calculate
      M and M n w .

  - context: |
      As the previous discussion has shown, many important synthetic polymers such as
      polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) consist of long, flexible chains of very
      high molecular weight. In many cases, individual chains are randomly coiled and
      intertwined with no molecular order or structure. Such a physical state is termed
      amorphous. Commercial-grade (atactic) polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate)
      are examples of polymers that are amorphous in the solid state. Below a certain
      temperature called the glass-transition temperature (Tg), long-range, cooperative
      motions of individual chains cannot occur; however, short-range motions involving
      several contiguous groups along the chain backbone or substituent group are possi-
      ble. Such motions are called secondary-relaxation processes and can occur at
      tem-
      peratures as low as 70 K. By comparison, glass-transition temperatures vary from
      150 K for polymers with very flexible chains such as polydimethylsiloxane
      to well over 600 K for those with highly rigid aromatic backbones such as the high-
      modulus fiber poly[2,2'-(m-phenylene)-5,5'-bibenzimidazole] (PBI) (see Section
      10.2.1)
      with a Tg reported in the range from 700 to 773 K.
      Polymer chains with very regular structures, such as linear polyethylene and
      isotactic polypropylene, can be arranged in highly regular structures called crystal-
      lites. Each crystallite consists of rows of folded chains. Since sufficient thermal en-
      ergy is needed to provide the necessary molecular mobility for the chain-folding
      process, crystallization can occur only at temperatures above Tg. If the temperature
      is too high, chain folds become unstable and high thermal energy disorders the crys-
      tallites—a crystalline–amorphous transition then occurs. The temperature that
      marks this transition is called the crystalline-melting temperature or Tm. Crystalline
      melting temperatures can vary from 334 K for simple, flexible-chain polyesters
      such as polycaprolactone
      to over 675 K for aromatic polyamides such as poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide)
      (Nomex)
      As an approximate rule of thumb, Tg is one-half to two-thirds of Tm expressed in
      absolute temperature (Kelvins). The glass-transition and crystalline-melting temper-
      atures can be determined by a wide range of techniques including measurement of
      volume (dilatometry), specific heat (calorimetry), and mechanical properties, par-
      ticularly modulus (e.g., dynamic mechanical analysis), as discussed in Chapter 4.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the glass-transition temperature (Tg)?
        answer: |
          It’s the temperature below which a polymer becomes glassy and brittle, and above which it becomes rubbery.
      - question: |
          What does Tm (melting temperature) represent in a polymer?
        answer: |
          The temperature at which crystalline regions of a polymer melt into the amorphous state.
      - question: |
          How are amorphous and crystalline polymers different?
        answer: |
          Amorphous polymers lack long-range order; crystalline polymers have ordered chain folding regions (crystallites).
      - question: |
          How does polymer structure affect Tg and Tm?
        answer: |
          Flexible chains lower Tg, while rigid or aromatic backbones raise both Tg and Tm.
      - question: |
          What rule relates Tg to Tm?
        answer: |
          Tg is typically one-half to two-thirds of Tm (in Kelvins).
