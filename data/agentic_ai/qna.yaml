      Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research
      For the last few years generative AI or gen AI, has been the hot new thing
      among technologists, but a new term has crept into artificial intelligence (AI)
      development communities recently. “Agentic” is the latest buzzword in AI,
      and in this case, it’s appropriate to believe the buzz. Agentic AI brings
      together the versatility and flexibility of large language models (LLMs)
      and the precision of traditional programming.
      Agentic AI refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously
      performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its
      workflow and using available tools. The system has “agency” to make decisions,
      take actions, solve complex problems and interact with external environments
      beyond the data upon which the system’s machine learning (ML) models were trained.
      AI agents draw not only from databases and networks, but can also learn from
      user behavior, improving over time. Agents’ adaptability enables them to
      handle complex, multistep AI applications that traditional AI would not be
      able to handle, making them a key part of the modern organization’s process
      automation strategy.
      If you were to ask a general-purpose LLM chatbot such as ChatGPT what
      ice cream maker to buy, that model’s natural language processing (NLP)
      capabilities would enable it to give recommendations based on its
      training data, which would probably include information scraped from
      the internet. But you don’t want generic advice from the past, you need
      advice that considers real-time information.
      An agentic AI platform consists of an LLM that orchestrates the behavior of
      multiple agents that can be deployed across various applications. These agents
      might be more AI models, or they might be simple search tools that can quickly
      look up information in a knowledge base or online. To continue the preceding
      example, imagine if an LLM such as GPT also had access to real-time e-commerce
      data and your payment details.
      An agentic AI platform like this could not only tell you that people love a
      specific ice cream maker that is on sale at a specific retailer, but it could
      theoretically make the purchase on your behalf. Agentic AI gets us closer to
      the use cases that we, until recently, thought of as science fiction, where
      machines can complete complex tasks involving complex workflows, data-driven
      decision-making and action-taking with minimal human intervention.

      1. Both flexible and precise
      LLMs excel at processing and generating human-like text, making it easier for
      users to interact with AI using natural language commands. This reduces the need
      for explicit programming knowledge. LLMs can generate responses or actions based
      on nuanced, context-dependent understanding, which is useful in scenarios where
      traditional programming might struggle to cover all edge cases. On top of this,
      LLMs are creative in tasks such as content generation, code completion
      summarization and more. This generative capability is hard to replicate with
      traditional rule-based programming.
      Meanwhile, traditional programming is highly structured, deterministic and
      reliable, making it ideal for tasks that require precision, repeatability
      and verifiability. Traditional programming languages provide granular control
      over how tasks are executed, helping to ensure that complex workflows, algorithms
      or specific system requirements can be explicitly defined and optimized. Traditional
      programming is often more efficient for tasks that require high performance or
      unique functions.
      Agentic AI systems provide the best of both worlds: using LLMs to handle tasks
      that benefit from flexibility and dynamic responses, while combining these AI
      capabilities with traditional programming for strict rules, logic and performance.
      This hybrid approach enables the AI to be both intuitive and precise. Agents can
      autonomously perform tasks while adapting to new data or dynamic environments,
      something that’s challenging for static code. At the same time, critical processes
      (such as security or calculations) can rely on deterministic, traditional algorithms.
      An agentic AI-powered system might contain simple reflex agents that perform one
      simple task well and consistently. More complex rule-based agents can use current
      perception and draw on memory, enabling them to receive and store new information,
      allowing it to perform a wider range of tasks. Learning agents can also ingest new
      data, but can use this to inform later decisions, improving accuracy over time.
      A powerful agentic AI platform might involve dozens or even hundreds of agents
      of varying capabilities working together.

      2. Extended reach
      LLMs are typically trained on static data sets that represent a snapshot of
      information up to a certain point in time. LLMs can’t actively go out and gather
      new information from the web after their training period. They can only generate
      responses based on what they already "know." They can't access or update real-time
      data from external sources on their own.
      LLMs cannot directly interact with external tools or data processing systems (such
      as spreadsheets, cloud platforms or analytics software) or autonomously set up
      systems to monitor and collect ongoing data (such as IoT sensors, business processes
      or logs from systems) because they’re not designed to perform continuous tasks.
      Agentic AI can be designed to search the web, call application programming interfaces
      (APIs) or query databases. Agents can fetch real-time information, retrieve updates
      or pull specific data points that are critical for decision-making. Agents can
      initiate and manage tasks such as data logging, real-time monitoring and trend
      analysis. They can proactively track and collect data streams from IoT devices,
      social media feeds or other systems, providing LLMs with fresh inputs for more
      informed decision-making and contextual responses.
      Agentic AI can use feedback loops where it actively seeks out new data to refine
      its models or decision-making processes. This might involve periodically querying
      new sources, collecting user feedback or analyzing real-world outcomes to update
      and improve its understanding or strategies. This way, the LLM can achieve
      optimization over time from richer, continually evolving data.

      - question: What are some examples of data that LLM cannot access?
        answer: |
          LLMs cannot directly interact with external tools or data processing systems (such
          as spreadsheets, cloud platforms or analytics software) or autonomously set up
          systems to monitor and collect ongoing data.
      - question: What data can agentic AI use that an LLM cannot?

          (APIs) or query databases. Agents can fetch real-time information, retrieve updates
          or pull specific data points that are critical for decision-making.
      - question: How can agentic AI use feedback loops?
        answer: |
          Agentic AI can use feedback loops to actively seek out new data to refine
          its models or decision-making processes.

      3. Autonomous
      With the big brains of LLMs and the targeted capabilities of agents, agentic AI
      can operate independently and autonomously perform specific tasks without the
      need for constant human oversight. This enables continuous operation in environments
      where human supervision is limited or unnecessary. Autonomous systems can maintain
      long-term goals, manage multistep tasks and track progress over time.
      For example, an agentic AI could be tasked with managing a marketing campaign,
      continuously monitoring performance, adjusting strategies and optimizing
      results based on feedback without the need for human input at every step.
      In healthcare, agents can monitor patient data, adjust treatment recommendations
      based on new test results and provide real-time feedback to clinicians.
      In cybersecurity, agents can continuously monitor network traffic, system logs
      and user behavior for anomalies that might indicate potential security threats,
      such as malware, phishing attacks or unauthorized access attempts. In supply
      chains, AI can autonomously place orders with suppliers or adjust production
      schedules to maintain optimal inventory levels.
      In human resources, agents can analyze the role and background of the new hire
      to create personalized onboarding training paths. It can adjust content and
      learning materials based on the individual’s prior experience, role requirements
      and learning pace.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How could and agentic AI manage a marketing campaign?
        answer: |
          Agentic AI could manage a marketing campaign by continuously monitoring performance,
          adjusting strategies and optimizing results based on feedback without the need for
          human input at every step.
      - question: What could agentic AI do in healthcare?
        answer: |
          AI agents could monitor patient data, adjust treatment recommendations
          based on new test results and provide real-time feedback to clinicians.
      - question: What could agentic AI do for cybersecurity?
        answer: |
          In cybersecurity, agents can continuously monitor network traffic, system logs
          and user behavior for anomalies that might indicate potential security threats,
          such as malware, phishing attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

      4. Intuitive
      One can imagine many business functions currently performed with software as
      a service (SaaS) products being replaced or augmented by agentic systems, which
      enable workers to interact with data and perform tasks more efficiently with
      natural language inputs and simplified user interfaces.
      For example, imagine a ticketing system that software developers use to track
      the progress of projects. Such a system requires many tables, tabs and workflows
      that aren’t always easy to understand at first glance. To find out useful
      information, users need to hunt for the right data, navigating a complex
      array of menus to get the information they need. Then, they might need to
      use that information to create a presentation.
      What if, instead of arraying all of that data in tables and tabs, the user
      only had to ask for the information he or she needs in plain human language?
      For example, imagine generating a presentation slide that displays 5 bar graphs
      representing every completed ticket per employee for the current month,
      going back 5 years, all without manually sorting through complex data sets.
      It might have taken half an hour to fetch that data manually and another
      half an hour to display it in a tidy format for a slick presentation, but
      agents could pull this together in seconds.
      For organizations struggling to see the benefits of gen AI, agents might be the
      key to finding tangible business value. Monolithic LLMs are impressive but
      they have limited use cases in the realm of enterprise AI. It remains to be
      seen whether the vast sums of money currently being poured into a handful of
      huge LLMs will be recouped in real-world use cases, but agentic AI represents
      a promising framework that brings LLMs into the real world, pointing the way
      to a more AI-powered future.
